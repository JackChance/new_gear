# Process

1. Establish the costs associated with the work
  * For existing items use the price as the total cost
  * For items not listed but that logically exist use a similar item's price as total cost
  * For novel items use the Invention rules (B473-477) instead of these rules for design and prototyping. Once the Production phase (B476) has been reached these rules will be used instead
2. Determine labor and material costs
  * Normally labor cost is 80% of an items value, material is 20% 
  * Valuable Material modifier alters costs to 20% labor, 80% material
3. Establish modifiers for labor
  * Normally the GM will pick appropriate modifiers from the list in Labor Modifiers below
  * Check blueprint level available, -4 for no blueprint or a bonus equal to the blueprint level otherwise
4. Determine timeline
  * Most projects are measured in hours, with a roll per hour to contribute to the project. Especially large projects such as building a house might use days or weeks as their cycle instead. As a general rule the timeline should never be less than 1 hour per cycle and should have at least 4 cycles if a time longer than 1 hour is selected.
  * The progress listed below is per hour. If the cycle is longer than an hour multiply progress appropriately.
5. Provide material cost
  * This can be done by spending money at stores or doing appropriate labor to gather material, or a mix. Gathering checks would follow the same pricing per hour as below, but keep in mind the availablilty of supplies and the actual tools used to gather them (picking up deadwood or stones with your hands would be Stone Age level tools, for example)
6. Collect skill modifiers
  * Modifiers for types of tools still apply to the roll, i.e. a TL 5 mini-kit still provides -2 to the skill test setting it apart from a TL 5 portable kit
  * Some Labor Modifiers also give modifiers to the skill test
  * On any cycle the crafter can voluntarily take on a penalty. For every -1 increase their output by 10% for that cycle, up to 100% for -10. Conversely, they can reduce their output for a +1 for every -20% progress up to +4 for -80%
  * Lighting and other environmental modifiers apply as normal
  * A solo crafter can normally benefit from Single-Minded but if multiple crafters are involved they cannot
7. Collect progress modifiers
  * Typical progress modifiers will come from voluntary modifiers and labor modifiers
8. Spend the time
  * Equal to the cycle establised in step 5
9. Make skill check
  * Assuming the crafter(s) are uninteruppted they can make their skill check. 
  * Critical Success: Treat as success with double output
  * Success: Gain the progress indicated by the tool's TL multiplied by any modifiers from step 7
  * Failure: Gain one half the progress indicated by the tool's TL multiplied by any modifiers from step 7 except voluntary increased output
  * Critical Failure: Lose 10% of your accumulated progress and require 10% of the materials cost before further attempts can be made
10. Check progress
  * If progress is equal to or greater than the required amount the job is done! Excess can either be prorated or applied to an identical item if there is enough material supplies on hand.
  * If progress is less than the required amount return to step 5 (though unless a critical failure was rolled there will be no further material cost required, and normally modifiers will be unchanged for step 6 unless the crafter changes tool sets or changes their voluntary modifier, or the environment changed during the last time cycle such as lighting from the sun setting or weather from a storm rolling in)


# Progress per hour by tool TL

| TL | Age | Requirements | Progress |
|-|-|-|-|
|0|Stone|-| $3.55|
|1|Bronze|-| $3.69|
|2|Iron|-|$3.84|
|3|Medieval|-|$3.98|
|4|Age of Sail|-|$4.55|
|5|Industrial|-|$6.25|
|6|Mechanical/Electrical|Electricity|$9.09|
|7|Nuclear|Electricity|$11.93|
|8|Digital|Computer|$14.77|
|9|Microtech|Computer|$20.45|
|10|Robotics|Computer|$31.82|

TL 6+ tools without access to power behave as TL 5. TL 8+ tools without access to a computer behave as TL 7.

# Blueprints

Blueprints are always a labor-only project that uses design tools as their TL tool. The maximum level a designer can upgrade a blueprint to is thier realative skill level in the design task, minimum 0.
The cost of the blueprints is the blueprint level squared times one half.

# Labor Modifiers

|Name|Labor Modifier|Description| Special|
|-|-|-|-|
|Easy|x0.5|A task that is unusually simple| +4 to skill check
|Hard|x2|A task that is unusually hard| -4 to skill check
|Precision|x1.5|Interlocking parts or other precise crafting required|Labor Modifier becomes x0 on a failed skill roll
|Delicate|x1.5|Components are unusually fragile or only provide one chance to get it right| Failure or Critical failure cost +10% of the material cost before further attempts can be made
|Miniturized|x10|Components are hard to see or handle due to size| x3 penalty for missing/inappropriate tools
|Valuable parts|x1|Most of the objects value stems from its components, such as jewelry| Material costs 80%, Labor costs 20% of items value
|Integrated| x1.5 | Components are tightly coupled, like clockwork| Failure and critical failure costs +10% of the accumulated progress

# Parting Notes

These rules assume the construction is from scratch. If it's a repair job instead it's up to the GM to determine the consumerate amount of materials and labor required. In some cases there might be no material cost even. It might also be appropriate to change the default cycle from hours to minutes or even seconds for very simple jobs, in which case the units wouldn't be GURPS bucks but a simple point system.

The numbers were derived from how much an average laborer would earn per TL. Being Wealthy would have no impact on these numbers though access to better tools would allow a crafter to increase their voluntary penalty to 'earn' more without reducing thier chance of success.
